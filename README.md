# Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

# Project Overview

If you are looking for a more guided capstone project related to deep learning and convolutional neural networks, this might be just it. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed, developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 


 
# The Road Ahead

We break the notebook into separate steps.  Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook.

* [Step 0](#step0): Import Datasets
* [Step 1](#step1): Detect Humans
* [Step 2](#step2): Detect Dogs
* [Step 3](#step3): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* [Step 4](#step4): Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* [Step 5](#step5): Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* [Step 6](#step6): Write your Algorithm
* [Step 7](#step7): Test Your Algorithm

# Install

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy


Pandas


matplotlib


scikit-learn


keras




You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

I recommend you install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project
